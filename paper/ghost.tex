\section{\ghost: A General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool}\label{sec:ghost}
\subsection{A brief introduction to \csp / \cop}

Constraint  Satisfaction Problems  (\csp) and  Constraint Optimization
Problems  (\cop)   are  two  close  formalisms   intensively  used  in
Artificial  Intelligence  to   solve  combinatorial  and  optimization
problems. Constraint  Programming allows an intuitive  and uniform way
to model  problems, as  well as different  general algorithms  able to
solve any problems modeled by a \csp or a \cop.

The difference between a \csp and a \cop is simple:

\begin{itemize}
\item A \csp  models a satisfaction problem, \ie, a  problem where all
  solutions  are equivalent;  the goal  is then  to just  find one  of
  them. For  instance: finding  a solution of  a Sudoku  grid. Several
  solutions may exist, but finding one is sufficient, and no solutions
  seem better than another one.
\item A \cop models an  optimization problem, where some solutions are
  better than others.  For instance: Several paths may exist from home
  to workplace, but some of them are shorter.
\end{itemize}

Formally, a {\bf \csp} is defined by a tuple ($V$, $D$, $C$) such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $V$ is a set of variables,
\item $D$ is a domain, \ie, a set of values of variables in $V$,
\item $C$ is a set of constraints.
\end{itemize}

A  constraint  $c   \in  C$  can  be  seen  as   a  $k$-ary  predicate
$c:~V^k\rightarrow\{\top,\bot\}$ where $\top$ can be semantically
interpreted by true and $\bot$ by  false. Thus, regarding the value of
the  vector $V^k$,  we say  that $c$  is either  satisfied (equals  to
$\top$) or unsatisfied (equals to $\bot$).

Notice also that $D$ should formally be the set of the domain for each
variable in $V$, thus a set of  set of values. However it is common to
define the same set  of values for all variables of  $V$, thus one can
simplify $D$ to be the set of values each variable in $V$ can take.

A {\bf \cop} a defined by a tuple ($V$, $D$, $C$, $f$) where $V$, $D$ and
$C$  represent the  same  sets as  a  \csp, and  $f$  is an  objective
function to minimize  or maximize.

Above  a \csp  or a  \cop, one  can  build a  \csp formula  or a  \cop
formula,  respectively.   A  \csp/\cop  formula is  a  conjunction  of
constraints from $C$ applied to variables from $V$. We say a \csp/\cop
formula is satisfied  if there exists an assignment  $q: V \rightarrow
D$  such that  each constraint  of  the formula  is satisfied.   Since
\csp/\cop model a specific  problem $\mathcal{P}$, a \csp/\cop formula
will represent an instance of $\mathcal{P}$.

Roughly  speaking, there  exist two  different kind  of algorithms  to
solve \csp/\cop problems: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Tree-based  search algorithms,  also called  complete algorithms
  since they completely  explore the search space  of solutions, using
  smart moves  (backtracking, forward  checking, etc) to  localize and
  avoid dead-ends in the search space.
\item Meta-heuristics,  also called incomplete algorithms,  since they
  are based  upon local  moves to find  optimums, rather  than dealing
  with the problem  as a whole. In practice, these  algorithms are the
  only  viable methods  to  manage industrial-size  problems within  a
  reasonable runtime. On  the other hand, they cannot  prove they have
  found the optimal  solution, neither they cannot prove  there are no
  solutions to the given problem.
\end{itemize}

For \ghost, we have chosen a  meta-heuristic algorithm to be the heart
of the solver, {\it  Adaptive Search}~\cite{Codognet01}. The reason we
have chosen  a meta-heuristics is  simple: To solve  combinatorial and
optimization problems while playing a RTS game, the solver needs to be
very fast to find a solution,  within some tens of milliseconds, which
is virtually impossible with  tree-based search algorithms. The reason
we  have  chosen  Adaptive  Search  is that,  although  it  is  not  a
well-known algorithm, it is one  of the fastest meta-heuristics at the
moment, up to our knowledge~\cite{Caniou14}.


\subsection{\ghost architecture}

Without  loss  of  generality,  \ghost  always  try  to  minimize  the
objective function  $f$. This  is trivially possible  since maximizing
$f$ corresponds to minimizing $1 / f$.

\section{Strategy problem: The build order}\label{sec:bo}
Refer to \cite{ChurchillB11, KuchemPR13, WeberM09, ChoKC13, Blackford14} 
\subsection{Problem statement}
A build  order planning is  a series  of actions following  a specific
timing, in order  to achieve a goal.  Such a goal is  a combination of
buildings,  units,  upgrades  and researches  produced.  Usually,  the
objective for a  player is to reach a fixed  goal the fastest possible
way. However, alternatives  can also be considered,  like reaching the
goal without sacrificing  the economy, or focussing first  on units in
order to have an army quickly available.

A  build order  planning can  be intuitively  modeled by  a \csp  as a
permutation problem,  where a bijection  maps the set of  variables to
the  domain. Changing  the  value  of one  variable  is then  actually
swapping its value with another variable.

All  actions have  a (potentially  empty) dependencies  list, \ie,  an
action  $\alpha$  has a  list  of  actions  that are  required  before
starting  $\alpha$.  For  instance, to  start the  \textit{Air Weapons
  Upgrade level  2}, it is  required to have finished  the \textit{Air
  Weapons Upgrade level  1}. Notice that we can  dive recursively into
these  dependencies  list. Thus  if  someone  aims to  do  \textit{Air
  Weapons  Upgrade  level  2}  for Protoss,  it  required  \textit{Air
  Weapons    Upgrade   level    1},    which    requires   itself    a
\textit{Cybernetics Core}, which requires a \textit{Gateway}.

The \csp model we propose for  the build order planning problem is the
following one:

\modelcsp{the Build Order Planning problem}%
{All actions we need to reach our goal.}%
{Order of actions.}%
{Each dependency of an action $\alpha$ must occurs before $\alpha$.}

    \hline
  \end{tabular}  
\end{table*}

For Table~\ref{tbl:bo}, \ghost has been run  10 times on each game. We
also analyzed replays  of games played by top  Korean pro-gamers, \ie,
Kim "Bisu" Taek Yong, Doh "BeSt"  Jae Wook, Woo "Violet" Jung Ho, Yang
"Cure" Jung  Hyun, all Protoss  players, against Lee "Flash"  Young Ho
(Terran), Lee "Jaedong"  Jae Dong (Zerg), Ma "sAviOr"  Jae Yoon (Zerg)
and match their build orders with \ghost \todonote{[Flo] no data here, but I can put
them}.

Computation time is  only 20ms for satisfaction runs and  30ms for the
(global) optimization run. This means that \ghost can compute a highly
optimized build order within one StarCraft frame only.

Why planing a build  order is easier than wall-in? A  huge part of the
answer is  that planing  a build  order can  be modeled  in \csp  by a
permutation  problem,  which  drastically decrease  the  combinatorial
complexity of the problem.

Set up:  \cite{ChurchillB11} gives too  advantageous set up.  Based on
the  analysis  of  games  from  Korean  pro-gamers  listed  above,  we
parameterized our simulator as follow (in StarCraft time t):
\begin{itemize}
\item Time to go build something: 5t (4t in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\item Time to go back gathering minerals after building something: 4t (0 in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\item Time to go from the base to mineral patches to start mining: 5t (0 in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\item Time for a probe to switch from mineral to gas: 5t (0 in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\item Mineral gathering rate: 0.68 mineral per worker per t (1.07 in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\item Gas gathering rate: 1.15 gas per worker per t (1.66 in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\end{itemize}
