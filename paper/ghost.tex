% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that

% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\section{Strategy problem: The build order}\label{sec:bo}
Refer to \cite{ChurchillB11, KuchemPR13, WeberM09, ChoKC13, Blackford14} 
\subsection{Problem statement}
A build  order planning is  a series  of actions following  a specific
timing, in order  to achieve a goal.  Such a goal is  a combination of
buildings,  units,  upgrades  and researches  produced.  Usually,  the
objective for a  player is to reach a fixed  goal the fastest possible
way. However, alternatives  can also be considered,  like reaching the
goal without sacrificing  the economy, or focussing first  on units in
order to have an army quickly available.

A  build order  planning can  be intuitively  modeled by  a \csp  as a
permutation problem,  where a bijection  maps the set of  variables to
the  domain. Changing  the  value  of one  variable  is then  actually
swapping its value with another variable.

All  actions have  a (potentially  empty) dependencies  list, \ie,  an
action  $\alpha$  has a  list  of  actions  that are  required  before
starting  $\alpha$.  For  instance, to  start the  \textit{Air Weapons
  Upgrade level  2}, it is  required to have finished  the \textit{Air
  Weapons Upgrade level  1}. Notice that we can  dive recursively into
these  dependencies  list. Thus  if  someone  aims to  do  \textit{Air
  Weapons  Upgrade  level  2}  for Protoss,  it  required  \textit{Air
  Weapons    Upgrade   level    1},    which    requires   itself    a
\textit{Cybernetics Core}, which requires a \textit{Gateway}.

The \csp model we propose for  the build order planning problem is the
following one:

\modelcsp{the Build Order Planning problem}%
{All actions we need to reach our goal.}%
{Order of actions.}%
{Each dependency of an action $\alpha$ must occurs before $\alpha$.}

For Table~\ref{tbl:bo}, \ghost has been run 10 times on each game. We also analyzed replays of games played by top Korean pro-gamers (Bisu, BeSt, Violet, Cure, against Flash, Jaedong, Savior) and match their BO with \ghost (no data here, but I can put them). 

Computation time is only 20ms for satisfaction runs and 30ms for the (global) optimization run. This means that \ghost can compute a highly optimized build order within one StarCraft frame only.

Why BO is easier than wall-in? Because BO can be modeled in \csp by a permutation problem, which drastically decrease the combinatorial complexity of the problem.

Set up: \cite{ChurchillB11} gives too advantageous set up. Based on the analysis of games from Korean pro-gamers listed above, we parameterized our simulator as follow (in StarCraft time t):
\begin{itemize}
\item Time to go build something: 5t (4t in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\item Time to go back gathering minerals after building something: 4t (0 in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\item Time to go from the base to mineral patches to start mining: 5t (0 in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\item Time for a probe to switch from mineral to gas: 5t (0 in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\item Mineral gathering rate: 0.68 mineral per worker per t (1.07 in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\item Gas gathering rate: 1.15 gas per worker per t (1.66 in \cite{ChurchillB11})
\end{itemize}
